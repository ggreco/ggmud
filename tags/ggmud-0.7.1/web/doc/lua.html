</span>
Since version <b>0.5</b> GGMud implements a fairly complete <a href="http://www.lua.org">LUA</a> interface that let you program the client through this powerful scripting language. This manual will cover <b>only</b> the GGMud lua interface and will give some examples about how to use it, it will not cover the basics of LUA scripting, you can find everything you need in the <a href="http://www.lua.org/docs.html">LUA documentation</a> or the <a href="http://lua-users.org/">LUA community site</a>.<p>
GGMud implements <b>LUA 5.1</b>, the interpreter is builtin in the executable so you don't need 
additional libraries to use it. The scripts should be ASCII files, the interpreter supports both DOS-like and unix-like files. The access to LUA script is provided in two different ways:<p><ul>
    <li>You can tell GGMud to parse a LUA script at the client startup, this can be done through the Preferences menu setting the <b>Lua startup script</b> to a script everywhere on your filesystem. This is the preferred loading method for the functions you want to be always available, for instance if you use them on multiple characters or if you play a single character.</li><p>
    <li>The <b>#script</b> command can load a lua script everywhere from your filesystem, you can also reparse a script already loaded with this command (after you fix for instance an error in the script). If you specify a script without extension the <b>.lua</b> extension will be automatically added to the path, so if you type:<p> <code>#script test</code><p> ... the client will search for <b>test.lua</b> in your current directory. Obviously you can use <b>#script</b> inside <a href="alias.html">alias</a> or <a href="triggers.html">triggers</a>.</li></ul>
<p>
<h3>Available functions</h3>
From inside a LUA script you have access to a range of GGMud specific interface functions:
<ul>
    <li>
    <b>show</b> - Display some text on the main window<p>
    Syntax: <code>show( string )</code><p>
    This function let you show some string on the main output window of the client, the string may
    contain classical <a href="colors.html">DIKU like color codes</a> to change the font color (<code>$c0000</code> is black 
    <code>$c0015</code> is white). The string is only show on the output window, the text you enter 
    is not sent to the mud.<p>
    Example:<ul> <code>show ( "$c0009Script loaded, client version $c0015" .. VERSION)</code><p>...this will print the text "script loaded, client version" in RED with appended the version string of GGMud in white.</ul>
    </li><p><br>
    <li>
    <b>clear</b> - Clear the contents of a window<p>
    Syntax: <code>clear( name )</code><p>
    This function will clear the entire contents of the window name you pass as parameter. It is useful to refresh status windows that don't need history.
    <p>
    </li><p><br>
    <li>
    <b>window</b> - Create a new window and display some text on it<p>
    Syntax: <code>window( name, text )</code><p>
    This command will open a new window named <b>name</b> and will draw <b>text</b> to it, if the window is already opened the text will be appended to the end. You can draw multiple lines at once using <b>\n</b> inside the string to specify a newline.<p>
    Example:<ul><code> window("speaks", "(" .. charname .. ") '" .. text .. "'" )</code><p>...this will open a window named "speaks" 
    (if the window is not already opened) and will print a string to it (something like <b>(Mongo) 'hello everyone!'</b>), 
</ul></li><p><br>
    <li>
    <b>trigger</b> - Add a new trigger<p>
    Syntax: <code> trigger( string, function_name )</code><p>

    This command let you define a LUA trigger. LUA triggers are different since the normal ones since you cannot edit them by hand, you cannot edit them through GUI, they are of a class of their own called <b>scripting</b>, this trigger class can only be created through LUA (but you can enable/disable it with the <b>Trigger Class</b> window). The first argument of the function is the string that will trig the trigger, this argument, as you'll see in the example, obeys to all the <a href="triggers.html">usual trigger rules</a>. The second parameter of the function is the function name <b>as string</b> you want to call when the parser find a match for your string. It's very important to remember <b>HOW</b> the arguments are passed to your function: you have up to nine variables (<b>%1</b>, <b>%2</b> ... <b>%9</b>) you can use inside the match string, these will be passed, if used, to your trigger function in order, so if you use <b>%1</b> and <b>%3</b> instead of <b>%1</b> and <b>%2</b> your function will have two parameters and the contents of <b>%3</b> will be placed in the second parameter.<p>
    Example:<ul>
        <code>
            trigger("^[%1] shouts '%2", "handle_shout");<br>
            <br>
            function handle_shout(charname, text)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;window("speaks", "$c0009(" .. charname .. ") '" .. text .. " (shout)" )<br>
            end<br>
        </code><p>
        This code will invoke the function <b>handle_shout</b> every time a character shouts something with a string similar to <b>[Mongo] shouts 'hello everyone!'</b>, the function will redirect the string to the window named <b>speaks</b> with a different formatting and red color. 
    </ul>
    </li><p><br>
    <li>
    <b>untrigger</b> - Remove a previously created trigger<p>
    Syntax: <code> untrigger( string )</code><p>
    This function simply remove a LUA trigger previously defined, it's useful since you cannot remove a LUA trigger from the GUI interface, the string you pass to the function must be the same you passed to the trigger() function, notice, you can obtain the same effect using <b>send()</b> and <b>#unaction</b> from the <a href="cmdline.html">command line</a>.<p>
    Example:<ul>
        <code>untrigger("^[%1] shouts '%2")</code><p>
        Remove the trigger defined in the <b>trigger()</b> function example.
    </ul>
    </li><p><br>
    <li>
    <b>send</b> - send some text to the mud, passing through the GGMud parser<p>
    Syntax: <code> send( string )</code><p>
    This function is very important since it is not only the <b>only</b> way to send something to the mud through a LUA script, but it's also the way to interact with GGMud command line commands and aliases. The argument of the function is a string that is parsed by GGMud and then, if not filtered, sent to the mud. Inside the string you can use any GGMud command or any user defined alias, you can also use <b>semicolon</b> to send the mud multiple commands (or perform multiple GGMud commands).<p>
    Example:<ul>
        <code>send("stand;get $weapon;wield $weapon")</code><p>
        Provided you have a variable pointing at your weapon name called <b>weapon</b> with this command you'll stand up and you'll get your weapon from the ground and wield it. This is just an example to show the fact you can use the GGMud parser in the <b>send()</b> argument string.
    </ul>
    </li><p><br>
    <li>
    <b>idle_function</b> - choose a function you want to be called every second<p>
    Syntax: <code> idle_function( function_name )</code><p>
    This function will inform GGMud to call the function named <b>function_name</b> (the parameter has to be passed as string) every second. This can be very useful to add actions that do not depend on mud inputs.
    You can access any global variable or function in the idle function. The only thing to remember is to be careful to avoid too complex idle functions, they can slow down your client. You can only have an idle function at time, another call to this function will replace the first idle_function with the new one.<p>
    Example:<ul>
        <code>
            idle_loops = 0<br>
            <br>
            function myidle()<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;idle_loops = idle_loops + 1<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;if idle_loops > 75 and combat == false and is_afk == false then<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;idle_loops = 0<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send("score")<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
            end<br>
            <br>
            idle_function("myidle")<br>
        </code><p>
        This example will add an idle function to your client so that your character will perform the score command every 75 seconds, this may be useful for instance to update a status window, is_afk and combat are variables defined and updated elsewhere in your code. 
    </ul>
    </li><p><br>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Variables &amp; functions</h3>
    Every <b>global</b> lua variable is visible to GGMud, every GGMud defined variable (with the <b>#var</b> command) is visible to 
    the LUA scripts as global variable. So it's safe to assume that given a certain variable name their values in LUA and in the
    GGMud internal scripting engine is the same. Every GGMud variable is exported as string, anyway the weak type checking of LUA let you do arithmetical operations on these variables.<p>
    You can access any non local LUA function from GGMud, this can be useful to embed LUA code in you aliases, to call a LUA function you have to prefix his name with the <b>&amp;</b> character, you can then include function parameters in between braces, the function must be called with the correct number of parameters or you will get a LUA runtime error.<p>
    Example:<ul>
        <code>
            <b>GGMud alias (provided you have three weapons called pierce slash blunt):</b><br><br>
            #action slash {&amp;changeweapon(slash)}<br>
            #action blunt {&amp;changeweapon(blunt)}<br>
            #action pierce {&amp;changeweapon(pierce)}<br>
            <br>
            <b>LUA script (previously loaded via #script or at GGMud startup):</b><br><br>
            weapontype = "UNDEF"<br>
            <br>
            function changeweapon(wt)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;if wt == weapontype then<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;show("You are already using damage type " .. wt)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;if weapontype="UNDEF" then<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send("rem slash;rem pierce;rem blunt")<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;else<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send("rem " .. weapontype)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;send("wield " .. wt)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;weapontype = wt<br>
            end<br>
    </ul>
    <b>NOTE:</b> The <b>save variables</b> option in the preferences window can be used to save the value of the variables 
    defined through the GGMud GUI or the #var command, so if you want to keep the value of a LUA variable across playing sessions you should define the variable in the GGMud interface and not in your LUA scripts, you cannot define it in BOTH places otherwise the last loaded value will be the variable value and this is not wanted.
<p>
<h3>Scripting examples</h3>
In this section there are some "real-world" scripting example that will give you the needed hints to be able to use the GGMUD LUA interface in a valuable way. The scripts will probably not be usable straight in your favourite mud since triggers works on EXACT strings and it's very difficult to find muds that use the same strings also if based on the same codebase.
