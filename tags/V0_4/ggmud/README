GGMud
-----

GGMud is a graphical mud client, it uses GTK 1.2.x for its graphic
window and support most of the tt++ command set.

Actually GGMud is born from a MERGE of the command line client 
tintin++ and the graphical client SClient. 

In the current stage most of the ggmud configuration should be made
manually editing the file .tintinrc placed in your home directory,
or building your alias/trigger/highlight and gag online with the 
correct commands (#action, #alias, #high, #gag).

The syntax is the tintin++ one.
