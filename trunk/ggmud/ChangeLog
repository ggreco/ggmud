0.9.3:
	- Fixed behaviour of menu shortcuts on OSX Mavericks
	- Added a few new menu shortcuts (ALT+m - macros, ALT-g - gags...)
	- Fixed Lumen & Umbra specific autostand lua trigger.
0.9.2:
	- Added new lua command filter_function that let you filter every
	  line received from the mud with LUA. Filter function MUST return
	  a boolean, if the boolean is false the filtered text is not
	  show nor processed by the ggmud internal engine.
	- Fixed socks support on Windows
	- Added a new preset of aliases/triggers/lua script for the italian 
	  mud Lumen & Umbra, while these may not be used directly in other
	  muds they are useful for learning some GGMud programming basics.
	- Reduced the size of the default font on Windows.
	- Increased the default size of the main window from 600x400 to 
	  800x600.
	- New build system based on CMake, it allows easily to build on
	  linux every GGMud version, the old system is still available
	  using make -f Makefile.legacy.
	- The lua script you specify on the configuration does not need
	  anymore a full absolute path to be loaded, if the script has
	  no path we'll search for it in the GGMud configuration 
	  directory.
	- GGMud is now distributed with GTK 2.24.10 on windows.
	- GGMud for OSX is now an intel only 10.5+ binary (but you can
	  build yourself an X11 or 10.4 or PPC version from sources 
	  if you have the skills to do so).

0.9.1:
	- Added menu option to clear the review buffer.
	- Some optimizations in network input handling (removed a data
	  copy).
	- Implemented #SLOW, #STEP, #STOP, #OK commands with semantics
	  similar to ZMUD ones:

0.9.0:
	- sqlite3 integrated.
	- LUA now supports SQL through SQLite3 and the official luasql
	  interface (http://www.keplerproject.org/luasql/)
	- Added new panel for adding/editing/removing substitutions.
	- Variables can now be removed from gui.
	- Now after you click a button the focus will be moved on 
	  the input line (and not on the button) and the input line
	  if not empty will be selected.
	- Improved #grep behaviour to avoid results relative to previous
	  searches.
	- Improved #message command, now the first parameter must be
	  one of info, warning, error (case insensitive) and it determines
	  the icon to use for the (not modal) popup.

0.8.1:
	- Added #grep command to search for strings in your review
	  buffer.
	- Now you can specify double quotes or brackets ( "" or [] ) 
	  around arguments for lua funcions, this allows you to pass
	  strings containing the , and ) character.
	- Implemented ZMud like review buffer activation and navigation
	  with PGUP/DOWN.
	- Now it's possible to send LARGE quantities of text to the 
	  mud through cut&paste without crashing it.
	- New autoupdate function, will ask for the latest version from
	  a support site, this one will open the download page in your
	  browser if you choose to update.
	- Fixed dependencies in makefile.
	- Initial MSP support.
	- Fixed crash with MCCP in certain situations.
	- Added URL detection in output window, URLs will be underlined
	  and clickable if you enable this.
	- Implemented command line switch "-nohome" to tell GGMud to use
	  the program directory to save his config files, this is useful
	  to be able to have a "portable" GGMud on a USB stick.

0.8.0:
	- Added button support:
	  New commands hbutton, vbutton
	  New gui to create/remove buttons
	  New config file <dir>/buttons
	- Added trigger special character '$' that match the end of a line:
	  example:
	  #action {says '%1'$} { do_something }
	  ... will match the whole line also if it contains quotes.
	- Corrected a bug in the trigger GUI that could crash the client.
	- Add new config toggle SkipTaskbar and relative option in the 
	  preferences panel to tell ggmud to skip taskbar for his windows
	  (useful to "hide" ggmud fast if you are playing in office).
	- Added new font configuration dialog, now you can have different
	  fonts for input/output window and GUI.

0.7.2:
	- Corrected a bug in variables math, worked correctly only from
	  lua, now the #math command works again.
