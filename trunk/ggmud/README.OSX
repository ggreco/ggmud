Actually the OSX version of GGMud uses the X11 version of GTKi and should be
run from shell. 
To be able to run it  you need to install the Apple or the Fink X11 server and the package GTK.

NOTICE: If you are able to run GIMP or OpenOffice you already HAVE the needed libraries.

To use the configuration file do something like:
mv ggmud.cfg <your home>/.tintinrc
