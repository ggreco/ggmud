GGMud
-----

GGMud is a graphical mud client, it uses GTK 2.x for its graphic
interface and support most of the tt++ command set. The goal of GGMud is
to be as complete as ZMud is, so it borrowed a few features from it
and has also a partial command compatibility with zmud.

GGMud is born from a MERGE of the command line client tintin++ and 
the graphical client SClient. This was about 4 years ago, since that
I've made a lot of changes and now there is really very few code from his
predecessors :)

The GGMUD configuration may be done through gui (there is a separate panel
and file for every kind of configuration object: triggers, aliases...)
or through command line, the full set of tintin++ commands is supported, 
as said before also a few zmud commands are supported.
