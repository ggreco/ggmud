GGMud
-----

GGMud is a graphical mud client, it uses GTK 2.x for its graphic
window and support most of the tt++ command set.

GGMud is born from a MERGE of the command line client tintin++ and 
the graphical client SClient. From its origins 3 years ago I've made
a lot of changes and now there is really very few code from his
predecessors :)

The GGMUD configuration may be done through gui or through command line,
the full set of tintin++ commands is supported, also a few zmud commands
are supported.

------------
Linux:
 glibc 2.x
 gtk 2.x
Win32:
 gtk 2.x (builtin in the installer)
